# CVRP-EAS
- An artificial ant colony algorithm for the vehicle routing problem

- The program simulated the use of an Elitistic ant system algorithm on a Capacitared vehicle routing problem. It was written using C# programming language. 
- The user has an ability to set the parameteres of the algorithm and to set a number and capacity of each vehicle used in a simulation.
